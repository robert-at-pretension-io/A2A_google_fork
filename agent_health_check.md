# Agent Health Check Proposals

This document outlines various approaches to improve agent availability detection and handling in the A2A framework.

## Goals

- Detect unavailable agents early in the startup process
- Provide clear error messages when agent connections fail
- Prevent cryptic errors like the "function_call" warnings
- Support all deployment environments (Kubernetes, Docker/Tilt, local development)
- Degrade gracefully when agents are unavailable

## Proposals

### Frontend Solutions

#### 1. Startup Health Check Service

Implement a background service in the UI that verifies agent availability at startup.

**Implementation:**
- Create a dedicated health check service that runs when the UI initializes
- Attempt to connect to all registered agents with a lightweight "ping" request
- Display warning banners for any unreachable agents
- Provide detailed error messages and troubleshooting steps

**Advantages:**
- Early detection of connectivity issues
- User-friendly error messages
- Can work with existing agent implementations
- Simple to implement in the UI layer

**Compatibility:**
- Works across all deployment models
- No changes needed to agent implementations

#### 2. Agent Status Dashboard

Add a real-time status dashboard to monitor agent availability.

**Implementation:**
- Create a new UI page showing all registered agents and their status
- Use color-coded indicators (green/yellow/red) for agent status
- Include metrics like response time and last successful connection
- Allow manual refresh and implement auto-refresh options

**Advantages:**
- Provides ongoing visibility into agent availability
- Helps diagnose intermittent connection issues
- Useful for both users and administrators
- Can be extended with more detailed diagnostics

**Compatibility:**
- Works with any deployment model
- Can leverage existing agent endpoints

#### 3. Progressive Agent Registration

Enhance the agent registration flow with verification steps.

**Implementation:**
- When registering an agent, attempt to fetch its AgentCard to verify connectivity
- Cache successful verifications with configurable TTL
- Present detailed error information during registration failures
- Allow "force registration" with appropriate warnings

**Advantages:**
- Prevents registration of unavailable agents
- Provides immediate feedback about connectivity issues
- Simple user experience enhancement
- Reduces confusion from later failures

**Compatibility:**
- Works with the existing registration UI
- No agent-side changes required

### Backend Solutions

#### 4. Health Check Endpoint Requirement

Require all agents to implement a standard health check endpoint.

**Implementation:**
- Define a standard `/health` endpoint in the A2A protocol
- Endpoint returns agent status, version, and capabilities
- Services can probe this endpoint at startup and periodically
- Failed checks trigger warnings or automatic deregistration

**Advantages:**
- Consistent approach across all agents
- Enables automated health monitoring
- Can include detailed diagnostic information
- Compatible with standard monitoring tools

**Compatibility:**
- Requires updates to agent implementations
- Can be phased in with backwards compatibility

#### 5. Agent Readiness Probes

Implement Kubernetes-style readiness probes for all agents.

**Implementation:**
- For Kubernetes: Use native readiness probes in deployments
- For Docker/Tilt: Add health check logic to container startup
- For local development: Implement similar probe mechanism in Python
- Block UI startup or display warnings until critical agents are ready

**Advantages:**
- Leverages well-established patterns
- Prevents startup when critical services are unavailable
- Works well with container orchestration
- Handles transient startup issues gracefully

**Compatibility:**
- Different implementations needed for each deployment model
- Requires startup script modifications

#### 6. Circuit Breaker Pattern

Implement circuit breakers for agent communication.

**Implementation:**
- Add a circuit breaker to the agent communication layer
- After X failed attempts, temporarily mark an agent as unavailable
- Automatically attempt reconnection after a backoff period
- Visually indicate broken circuits in the UI

**Advantages:**
- Handles transient failures gracefully
- Prevents cascading failures
- Improves perceived responsiveness during outages
- Can automatically recover when services return

**Compatibility:**
- Requires changes to agent client code
- Works across all deployment models

#### 7. Dependency Graph and Startup Order

Map agent dependencies and control startup order.

**Implementation:**
- Define dependencies between agents and services
- Start agents in topological order based on dependencies
- UI waits for critical agents before becoming fully operational
- Non-critical agents start afterward with appropriate UI indications

**Advantages:**
- Ensures services start in the correct order
- Handles complex dependency chains
- Prevents startup race conditions
- Creates a reliable initialization sequence

**Compatibility:**
- Requires orchestration layer changes
- Different implementations for each deployment model

#### 8. Agent Proxy Layer

Add a proxy layer between the UI and agents.

**Implementation:**
- Introduce a proxy service between the UI and agents
- Proxy monitors agent health and handles failover
- Provides a consistent interface even when agents are unavailable
- Can offer degraded functionality or fallbacks

**Advantages:**
- Single point for monitoring and management
- Can provide fallback behaviors
- Simplifies client implementation
- Enables advanced routing and load balancing

**Compatibility:**
- Significant architecture change
- Adds complexity to the deployment

## Recommended Approach

For immediate improvement with minimal changes, a combination of:

1. **Startup Health Check Service** (frontend solution #1)
2. **Health Check Endpoint Requirement** (backend solution #4)

This combination provides:
- Early detection of unavailable agents
- Clear error messages for users
- A standard way to verify agent health
- Compatibility with all deployment models
- Minimal changes to existing code

## Implementation Steps

1. Define a standard `/health` endpoint for the A2A protocol
2. Update agent implementations to support this endpoint
3. Add a health check service to the UI that runs at startup
4. Enhance error messaging when agents are unavailable
5. (Optional) Add an agent status dashboard for ongoing monitoring

## Conclusion

By implementing these health check mechanisms, the A2A framework will provide a more robust user experience with clear error messages when agents are unavailable. This will prevent cryptic errors like the "function_call" warnings and help users quickly identify and resolve connectivity issues.
